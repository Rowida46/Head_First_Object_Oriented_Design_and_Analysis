# To sum up ::

## Abstract Classes

It work as a placehoulder for actaul implementation class tok define behavior, *However*
__subclasses__ implement that behavior.

## Encapsulation

The main objective of it is to protect your classes from unnecessary changes.
- Just try your hardest to encapsulate what varies.

### Generalization

Used to show that a class extends or inhierts form another class or a more generalized one.


### Aggregation
 
 It's a special form of association to show that onr thhing or class is made up of another class.

 
 ## Notes

- Treat your subclasses as a placeholders for actual implementation. The abs class  *defines* the behavior and subclass *implement* that behavior.

- Diff properties, Use hash map....!

#### What is interface ?

A class that lotsof classees can inheriet common behaviors 
- Coding to an interface rather than an implementation make your code easyto be extended.


 - Classes about the behavior, and the reason that we create subclasses is the diff properties.
